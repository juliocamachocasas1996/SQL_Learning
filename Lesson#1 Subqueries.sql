--Emlynne Torritti (id 20), has decided to drop band and join drama. She wants to know all of the other students in her grade level who are already enrolled in drama.

--If we compare this functionality in terms of efficiency, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS are usually more efficient than IN/NOT IN clauses; this is because the IN/NOT IN clause has to return all rows meeting the specific criteria whereas the EXISTS/NOT EXISTS
-- only needs to find the presence of one row to determine if a true or false value needs to be returned.
--In the previous exercise, we used an example query that pulled students who are enrolled in both statistics and history using IN â€” the following query pulls the same information using EXISTS instead:
SELECT * 
FROM statistics_students
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM history_students
  WHERE id = statistics_students.id
);

---Write a query that produces the first and last names of all the students who are enrolled in both band AND drama.

where exists (
  select first_name,last_name from drama_students
  where id=band_students.id
